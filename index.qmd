## About Me!

Hi! I'm Aidan - a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara. I'm interested in fire ecology and ecosystem restoration, and completed a senior research thesis on restoring native wildflowers to invasive grasslands as a transitional stage in restoring to coastal sage scrub. I love watching movies with my friends, spending time outdoors, obsessing over my Google Calendar, and a good spreadsheet!
