Working in a 4-person group, we created a 30-page proposal for the restoration of Lake Los Carneros, a 94-acre public park in Goleta, California. We assessed the site, analyzed the opportunities and challenges in restoration, proposed restoration actions, and created a budget and timeline to complete the project within 2 years with \$500,000. The proposed restoration would restore 20 acres of perennial grassland and reduce soil compaction with the implementation of a controlled burn, grazing, tilling, soil amendments, and native plant seeding.
